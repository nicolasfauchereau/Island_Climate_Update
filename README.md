## Processes to run to create the various products going into the Island Climate Update bulletin


### 1) update the GPM / IMERG rainfall daily data:

Note: you first need to create an EarthData login, and follow the instructions at [https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access) to setup 
your machine to be able to download the TRMM/GPM data from [https://gpm1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/GPM_L3/GPM_3IMERGDL.06/](https://gpm1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/GPM_L3/GPM_3IMERGDL.06/).   

For `curl` (or `wget`) you will need to create a `~/.netrc` file, instructions at [https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access#mac_linux_wget](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/data-access#mac_linux_wget)

+ cd into `~/operational/ICU/ops/data/GPM_IMERG/daily/extended_SP/` and note the date of the last netcdf file
+ activate the `pangeo` (need to include xarray, salem and the Python 'geospatial' stack in particular) environment and cd into `~/operational/ICU/ops/data/TRMM/daily/scripts/`
+ run:
```
python get_daily_GPM_IMERG_netcdf.py -o ../extended_SP -lonW 125 -lonE 240 -latN 25 -latS -50 -s YYYMMDD -e YYYYMMDD
```

where `-s YYYMMDD` indicates the start date (e.g. -s 20190228) and `-e YYYYMMDD` the end date for the download

### 2) update the time-series of GPM / IMERG anomalies and categories

+ cd into `~/operational/ICU/ops/GPM_IMERG/notebooks/`
+ run `5_get_latest_IMERG_TS_monthly_compare_to_climo.ipynb`: This notebook updates the time series of anomalies for each Island Group, which are saved in the folder `GMP_IMERG/outputs/Time_Series/last_6_months`
+ run `6_concat_last_6_months_csv.ipynb`: This notebook concatenates the individual time-series and saves the output (`last_6_months_TRMM_categories.csv`) in the corresponding bulletin folder (e.g. `bulletin/AMJ_2019/`). Do not forget to change the name of the bulletin folder at the beginning of the notebook.

### 3) calculates the 'tercile' probabilistic forecasts from the CDS ensemble forecasts (ECMWF, UKMO, Meteo-France, DWD and CMCC models)

+ cd into `operational/ICU/ops/copernicus/notebooks`
+ run `get_copernicus_seasonal_all_centres_precip_regionmask_ICU_geojsons_operational.ipynb`:
    + If the CDS ensemble forecasts (i.e. the individual ensemble members, NOT the ensemble mean) haven't been downloaded already, set `download` to True
    + do not forget to indicate where the forecasts are or will be downloaded, i.e. provide the path to the 'END19101' project drive.
    + do not forget to change the month and year (month the forecast is available, i.e. if in March and the forecast period is AMJ, month = 3)
    + do not forget to indicate the correct forecast directory name (e.g. `AMJ_2019` for April - June 2019)

### 4) calculates the water stress from the GPM / IMERG anomalies + the CDS forecasts

+ cd into `~/operational/ICU/ops/water_stress/notebooks/`
+ run `prepare_files_for_mapping_and_calculates_stress.ipynb`: do not forget to change the bulletin directory. This notebook reads the copernicus forecasts from the bulletin directory, saves a sanitized version for inclusion in the PPT (e.g. `ICU_forecast_table_for_PPT_AMJ_2019.csv`), reads the last 6 months GPM / IMERG anomalies (categories), calculates the Water Stress, and saves both the forecast table for mapping (`ICU_forecast_table_for_mapping.csv`) and the Water Stress for mapping (`ICU_stress_table_for_mapping.csv`).
+ run the notebook `prepare_table_for_Visual_Cortex.ipynb`: do not forget to change the bulletin directory. This notebook reads the copernicus forecasts from the bulletin directory, and saves a file (e.g. `ICU_Rainfall_for_Visual_Cortex_AMJ_2019.csv`) that is used for visualisation using Visual Cortex.

### 5) mapping

+ cd into `~/operational/ICU/ops/mapping/notebooks/`
+ run `make_ICU_gis_map_rainfall_forecast.ipynb` for the rainfall forecast map. Again do not forget to change the name of the bulletin directory at the beginning of the notebooks.
+ run `make_ICU_gis_map_water_stress.ipynb` for the Water Stress map. Same thing: set the bulletin directory at the beginning of the notebook.

### 6) GeoJSON files

The GeoJSON files corresponding to the forecast and water stress maps are generated by th emake_ICU_gis_map_rainfall_forecast.ipynb and make_ICU_gis_map_water_stress.ipynb notebooks (in the `mapping` folder) and saved in `~/operational/ICU/ops/mapping/geojsons`, they need to be copied on NIWA's FTP (anonymous@ftp.niwa.co.nz) in `/incoming/fauchereaun/ICU_outputs/{bulletin_directory} with `bulletin_directory` e.g. JFM_2020.
